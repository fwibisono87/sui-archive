# Introduction

## What Is This?

This is avery rudimentary guide on how to archive and store streams, compiled by a fan of [Hoshimachi Suisei](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CwaMl1eIgY8h02uZw7u8A).

## Why?

As much as we want to, it's not always the case that we can watch our favourite streams from start to finish. Some of us live in timezones that make it impossible to watch streams live. Some streamers mitigate this by leaving their streams archive up. 

Sadly, we cannot rely that stream archives will always be up. Here are a few examples
 * It is an unarchived karaoke stream <br />
 Often streamers sing songs that they do not have permissions for. It does not mean they are *illegal*, it just means that them (or their company) is trying to cover their bases and not get sued/copystriked in the future
 * Graduations/Wipes<br />
 In the regrettable, but sadly common occurence nowadays, streamers (especially VTubers), may graduate (stopping their activity). This may include their channels (and their entire back catalog) being sent to the shadow realm (e.g. Rushia Uruha. No Hyperlink because... yea...) <br /><figure> ![image](../static/img/shadow_realm.jpg) <figcaption align="center">*That was one step too far, Jimbo.*</figcaption></figure>  While some graduate amicably ([Kiryu Coco](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS9uQI-jC3DE0L4IpXyvr6w) and [Tsukumo Sana](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsUj0dszADCGbF3gNrQEuSQ) from Hololive, and soon, [Makoto and Akira Misaki](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6m64Oc1vvb_hpyOLRtxaYg) from GGN Live With You, among others), and managed to keep most of their back catalog up, some content (such as members-only content) are still gone forever.

## Acknowledgements
This guide builds on previous work done by [Aozaki](https://aozaki.cc/), who owned and maintaied [guide.suisei.cc](https://guide.suisei.cc) <sub>(I find it hillarious that said domain points to [https://www.nijisanji.jp/](https://www.nijisanji.jp/) now. <sub>Nothing like corpo rivalry, eh, kids?</sub>)</sub> and the wider ["Project Stargazer"](https://ko-fi.com/post/Details-of-the-work-I-am-currently-working-on-T6T66CQ71). They had [stepped down](https://ko-fi.com/aozaki) from said project late November 2022 due to personal reasons. 

Although said website was archived at [the Internet Archives](https://web.archive.org/web/20221004095611/https://guide.suisei.cc/), it doesn't work that well anymore, so I decided to make what is mostly a clone, with small improvements here and there. This website is based on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator, which ensures that this website can be archived properly if one day I forget to renew the domain registration.

Three names come to mind that I'd like to acknowledge personally. Mr [Rahmat Mustafa Samik-Ibrahim](https://cbkadal.blogspot.com/) (also known as Cicak Bin Kadal), my [Operating Systems](https://os.vlsm.org) professor, who encouraged creating guides to help others, LilBoyDestiny, who dragged me into this damn rabbithole in the first place, and of course, last but definitely not least, [Hoshimachi Suisei](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CwaMl1eIgY8h02uZw7u8A) herself.

Please leave comments, critique, and feedback, expecially if you have a better alternate solution. Hopefully this document will be useful in the future, when I have forgotten how to solve this trivial problem.
