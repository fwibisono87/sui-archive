# Prerequisite Tools

As this is a guide meant to help anyone be able to archive streams, I will not be prescribing a particular OS. Here is the setup that I have personally tested and known to work well.

## Operating Systems
* Windows 
    * Windows 11
    * Windows 10
* Linux
    * EndeavorOS (ArchLinux) <sub>I use arch btw</sub>
    * Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    * Linux Mint 19
